Hi, I'm Sebastian Arrieta, a Colombian software developer with a passion for building systems that positively impact people's lives. I'm driven by a love for learning new technologies and enhancing team collaboration in software development.

When I'm not coding or diving into my career, you'll find me reading my Bible or volunteering at my local church.

Currently, I'm focused on improving my writing skills through a blog where I share insights on programming and system design. I'm also excited about the journey of starting my own company.

## Projects

These are some projects that I'm proud of:

- [[CampusCal]]: A system to improve workflows of managing bookings of college spaces for the university of Cartagena! Made with Laravel, Vue.js, TailwindCSS.
- [[Horizon]]: A software made to manage issues in horizontal properties. React.js, Spring Boot.
- [[Shoppingify]]: A web app for shopping list management and analytics. Made with DDD in mind!
