I'm Sebastian Arrieta! I'm a software engineer based in Colombia.
I'm a software engineer with a passion for learning and building software that improves people's lives.

When I'm not typing away at my keyboard, you can find me practicing guitar, reading, or working out.
I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities. Let's connect and see how we can make an impact together!
